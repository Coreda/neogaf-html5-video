# NeoGAF HTML5 Video Embedder
A simple userscript that changes Mp4/WebM links on pages from NeoGAF.com to embedded HTML5 video elements.

Video scaling behaves identically to regular images on the forum, including when quoted. 

To use it you'll first need the [Tampermonkey addon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for Chrome, or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.
